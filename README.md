# Healthy Meals

It's a single-page application offering users access to vegetarian recipes from the Spoonacular API. With an easy-to-use and intuitive interface, users can seamlessly discover vegetarian recipes and their details: https://healthy-meals-nine.vercel.app.

# About the project 
I implemented a single-page application using Next.js to meet the project requirements, specifically the use of libraries such as React Router DOM and Redux. Otherwise, I understand it was not necessary because Next.js already handles everything optimally. The pattern I used is useful only if we don't want or it's not necessary to index the content of the website on search engines.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
